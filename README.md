# MarsRovers
Problem 1
There is only one class. Because I took the problem simple and therefore 
the solution also will be simple. I could implement it with much more classes.
There are some methods called printPosition(), process(String commands), 
process(Character command), move(), turnLeft() and turnRight(). I explained them on my source code.
I implemented the positions and instructions, so there is no input. After that, process(String command) 
takes these positions and instructions to examine them one by one and send them process(Character command)...
According to these char commands rover will turn left, right or just move one grid.
Then print...
